We get so much for "free" when building nowadays that it feels more like my
day consists more of consuming than producing.

When you sell your craft by time then every unit has to be spent wisely.

This is my escape and has only one intent:

    Be as framework-less as possible.

To start out and get over the hump I have allowed myself 3 plug 'n' play
libraries:

* javax.servlet-api-3.1.0.jar
* jetty-all-9.1.1.v20140108.jar
* [org.json.*](http://www.json.org/java/index.html)

By end of 2014 all of them will be replaced with hand-rolled counterparts.


Stop work time and begin playtime. Make something cool.
